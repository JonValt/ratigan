=======

ratigan stands for RATproxy Integrated Graphical Application 'Nspector.  That's a mouthful, ay?

The genesis of this project was the idea that "Ratproxy is hard.  Let's make it easy."

More documentation to come.  In the meantime, see https://vimeo.com/69189748 or the doc directory.

Does my code suck?  Great!  Submit a Pull Request!
